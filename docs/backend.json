    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to ensure security, scalability, and debuggability, following the principles of Authorization Independence, Clarity of Intent, DBAC (Database-Based Access Control), and QAPs (Rules are not Filters). It leverages denormalization, structural segregation, and consistent access modeling.\n\n**Authorization Independence:**\n\n*   Authorization data (e.g., roles, members) is denormalized into subcollections or documents where necessary. For instance, the `Collaboration` entity stores `userId` and `role` within the document itself, removing the need to fetch user roles from a separate location. This allows atomic operations (transactions/batches) without relying on parent data.\n\n**Structural Segregation:**\n\n*   The structure segregates data based on access needs. User-specific data (scripts) are stored under `/users/{userId}/scripts/{scriptId}`, while collaborative data is stored in `/scripts/{scriptId}/collaborations/{collaborationId}`. This prevents mixing data with different access requirements in the same collection.\n\n**Access Modeling:**\n\n*   **Path-Based Ownership:** User-owned scripts are stored under `/users/{userId}/scripts/{scriptId}`, which provides a clear ownership model.\n*   **Membership Map (Collaborations):** The `Collaboration` entity includes `userId` and `role` fields directly, acting as a membership map. This provides explicit information of which users have certain access or roles.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):**\n\n*   The structure supports secure `list` operations by ensuring that each collection has a homogeneous security posture. Rules can be written to allow listing only documents that the user has access to, based on path-based ownership or membership maps."
