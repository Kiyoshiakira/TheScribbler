/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the ScriptScribbler application.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that each user's data is isolated.
 * - Scripts, characters, and notes are stored as subcollections under each user's document.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data. Listing other users' data is disallowed.
 * - Data validation is relaxed during this prototyping phase to allow for rapid schema iteration. However,
 *   ownership and relational integrity are strictly enforced.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `authorId` field in the `Script` entity is used to enforce ownership, avoiding costly `get()` calls to
 *   a separate `/users` collection.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private data (user profiles, scripts) is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path.
